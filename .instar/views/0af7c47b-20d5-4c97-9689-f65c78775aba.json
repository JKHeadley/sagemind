Executive Summary\n\nSagemind AI proposes building a custom practice management dashboard for Dental City Costa Rica, integrated directly into their existing website. The system will handle appointment booking, employee scheduling, AI-powered payment tracking with receipt scanning, and income reporting — all behind a secure employee login with role-based access.\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n- Built on top of the existing Next.js website — no new platforms to learn\n- AI-powered receipt scanning — snap a photo, data auto-fills\n- Fully bilingual (EN/ES)\n- Near-zero infrastructure costs ($0–$20/mo on free tiers)\n- No monthly software subscriptions required\n\n---\n\n## 2.
