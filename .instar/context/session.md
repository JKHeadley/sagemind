# Session Continuity

## On Session Start

1. Note the current topic (if Telegram session)
2. Read thread history for conversational context
3. Check for pending upgrade guides
4. Verify identity (AGENT.md exists and is readable)

## On Compaction

Context was compressed. Recovery priority:
1. Topic context (what am I working on?)
2. Identity (who am I?)
3. Memory (what have I learned?)
4. Project context (where am I?)
5. Capabilities (what can I do?)

## On Resume

Re-read recent activity. Check if anything changed while you were paused.

## Session Handoff

When ending a session that another might continue:
- Update MEMORY.md with anything learned
- Note any incomplete work
- Save conversation context via topic memory
