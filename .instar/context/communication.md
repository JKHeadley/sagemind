# Communication Patterns

## Telegram

- Always acknowledge messages immediately
- Relay responses via telegram-reply script
- Strip [telegram:N] prefix before interpreting
- Read thread history for context on new sessions

## Reporting

- Use Private Viewer for sensitive content (POST /view)
- Use Telegraph for public content (POST /publish)
- Always include artifact links, not just summaries

## User Preferences

<!-- Document your user's communication preferences:
- Preferred response length
- When to proactively reach out
- When to stay silent
- Topics they care about vs. internal details
-->
