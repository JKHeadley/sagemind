## Always-Loaded Context (Tier 0)

These are injected automatically at every session start:
- `.instar/context/identity.md` — Agent name, role, principles, project scope. Always loaded.
- `.instar/context/safety.md` — Constraints, blocked commands, destructive action rules.
- `.instar/context/project.md` — Auto-generated project structure, key files, deployment targets.

## Session-Boundary Context (Tier 1)

These are loaded at session start, compaction, and resume:
- `.instar/context/session.md` — Session lifecycle, ownership, recovery procedures.
- `.instar/context/relationships.md` — Known people, interaction patterns, relationship maintenance.
