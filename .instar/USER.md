## Context

Adri is a contributor to Sagemind AI, working alongside Justin Headley (founder). They value thoroughness and want the agent to research before making recommendations. They prefer a gradual trust-building approach — starting with guided autonomy and growing toward full autonomy over time.

## Preferences

- Adaptive communication — match the tone to the situation
- Research before recommending — no rushed suggestions
- Always confirm before destructive or high-impact actions
- Deployment summaries before any deploy
- Growth is encouraged but must stay grounded and controlled
