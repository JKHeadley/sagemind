# Sagemind Google Forms Theme Standard

Standard theme settings for all Google Forms created by Sagemind AI. These settings must be applied manually in the Forms UI (Theme panel) since the Google Forms API does not support theme customization.

## Text Style

| Element  | Font             | Size |
|----------|------------------|------|
| Header   | Times New Roman  | 24   |
| Question | Roboto           | 12   |
| Text     | Arial            | 12   |

## Header Image

Use the Sagemind branded header banner:
- **File**: `brand/sagemind-form-header.png`
- **Dimensions**: 1600 x 400px (4:1 aspect ratio)
- **Design**: Dark navy (#02222e) background, small Sagemind logo left-center, bright cyan (#08f1c7) accent line at bottom

Upload via: Forms > Customize Theme > Header > Upload Image

## Colors

- **Theme Color**: Bright cyan (Sagemind brand — #08f1c7 or closest match in the Forms color picker)
- **Background**: Light steel blue/grey (last option in the background palette — muted blue-grey tint)

## How to Apply

2. Click the **palette icon** (Customize Theme) in the top toolbar
3. Set **Header** image by uploading `brand/sagemind-form-header.png`
