# Salon Website Research — Castro Valley

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Initial research complete, awaiting salon details

---

## Essential Pages

- **Homepage** — Hero image, tagline, "Book Now" CTA, services snapshot, reviews, location/hours
- **Services** — With transparent pricing (the #1 thing customers look for)
- **About / Meet the Team** — Personal bios, specialties, photos
- **Gallery** — Before/after photos organized by service type
- **Contact** — Map, hours, click-to-call, contact form
- **Book Now** — Embedded booking widget

## Must-Have Features

- **Online booking** — 46% of salon clients now book online. Two clicks max from any page.
- **Mobile-first design** — 86% of salon searches are on mobile
- **Click-to-call phone number**
- **Embedded Google Map**
- **Instagram/social links**
- **Fast load time** (<3 seconds)

## Booking Platform

All three competing salons in Castro Valley (Hairology, Studio W, Stacy Monroe's) use **Vagaro** for booking. Other good options:

- **Square Appointments** (free tier)
- **Booksy**

All can embed directly on the website.

## Design Patterns That Work

- "Book Now" always visible (sticky header or floating button)
- Minimal text, maximum visuals — photography does the heavy lifting
- Elegant serif fonts for headings + clean sans-serif body
- Testimonials/Google reviews prominently on homepage
- Location name (Castro Valley) visible throughout for local SEO

## Local SEO (Critical for a Salon)

- Fully optimized Google Business Profile (salons with 100+ photos get 520% more calls)
- Consistent name/address/phone across Google, Yelp, Apple Maps
- Location keywords throughout the site
- Claim listings on Yelp (huge in Bay Area), Facebook, Nextdoor
- Schema markup for local business

## Tech Stack Recommendation

Since we already work with Next.js + Vercel, recommended to **build custom** rather than using Squarespace/Wix:

- Faster, more polished site at comparable or lower hosting cost
- Simple CMS (like Sanity) so the owner can update services/prices/photos themselves

## Quick Launch Option

If they need something fast, start with a **single-page site**:
- Hero + Services + About + Gallery + Map + Booking link
- Expand into full multi-page site later

## Next Steps

- Get salon details: name, services offered, vibe/style
- Choose booking platform
- Gather photos/assets
- Build out project plan
