0:00 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  How's it going?

0:01 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  It's going great. This meeting is being recorded. Good. Yeah. It's Monday morning.

0:07 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  We're going to get some stuff done this week. Yeah. Happy Monday.

0:12 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  How are things going for you?

0:14 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Pretty good. Yeah. Life's all over the place. A little crazy, but it's fun.

0:24 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  I told you I'm going to have a bunch more work for you.

0:29 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Oh, really?

0:30 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  No. Well, so one, I'm really excited about, like, being able to make this work or you being able to make this work.  And I don't, like, I think there's a few more steps that I want to take to make sure everything is good, right?  Like you said, doing some testing and those types of things. So I want to get that set up. But even if it does nothing more than we've already made it do, it's success.

0:59 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Awesome.

0:59 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Thank you. Thank Thank And I'm optimistic about other things we're going to be able to make it do. So, yeah, I'm just kind of excited.  So for me, right now, jumping into kind of the details of it, I think I want to get a few more people set up to just help me test it and do more of what I was doing.  But I've got so much access, it's kind of hard to test some things because I have access to, like, everything, like, people's private files and that kind of stuff.  So when I do searches for things, it gives me a lot. Some of the things it did that I was happy about was I started asking, like, compensation questions for individuals that I actually have access to the files.  Like, it could have found it if it wanted to. But I got the responses, like, hey, I can't give you that.  And I was like, hey, I'm an exec, I have the answer, I have access to that data. And it's like, sorry, you know, in other words, but it was kind of, there are some guardrails.  That have been set up in this that I don't know if you had anything to do with it or it's just like ChatGPT is like trying to make sure people are not getting info they shouldn't have.

2:13 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Yeah, it wasn't me. It's hard to know where it's sourced from.

2:19 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  But that was really cool. So I just kind of wanted to like do other things and give other people with different levels of access, do some just testing.  But for the basics of project level search that I'm looking for that people will use every single day, like it's awesome, right?

2:37 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Like it's incredible.

2:39 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  You can search, you know, I just said like, hey, give me a list of Stanford projects with job numbers that we've done over the last two years.  And it gives you not just a list, but, you know, start dates, finish dates, all kinds of things. And you're just like, wow, this is this would have taken me or accounting or somebody a half an hour to pull together and you get it in like 30 seconds.  And so it's. It's pretty cool, and the stuff I'm getting back right now seems accurate, right? And if it's inaccurate, it's because I didn't ask the question, right?  That's great to hear, and it's still tunable, by the way, because it's, I don't know if you built a GPT before.

3:15 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Yes, I have. So, yeah.

3:17 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Yeah, so, and that's where I was headed with these guys, like, with the next group, I kind of, and say, like, hey, let's try things, and if things aren't working, we can, you know, we can aim it in a better direction, or tell it, no, that's not what we mean when we say this, or whatever, whatever it might be, so, but anyway, I'm really excited about it.  The biggest hole that I see that we have right now, just with this being, anyway, being as good as anything you could be buying from people, is that we've got a bunch of data in ACC that it doesn't see, because we're only looking at one data source in Ignite right now.  So, the... I guess the first thing I wanted to see if you could spend a little more time digging into, which we talked about before and you did some stuff, but we didn't really get there, was, hey, is there a way that we can get direct into our ACC data so that when we're asking project questions, it has that whole additional data set?  If the answer is no, like if we can't figure out how to make that work, there's a bunch of stuff in ACC that we can push directly to Ignite into our project files that we're not doing right now, but we can very, very easily do it so that there's more, you know, there's more access to stuff.  Um, um, but I don't want to go, that's like the, maybe a little bit more of a brute force.

4:46 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Right, right, right.

4:47 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  And if it'd be worth it to not, ACC has more data than we can even push in, if that makes sense.  So we can push like submittals and RFIs and change orders and all. Financial stuff, can press all that to have it make redundant kind of like PDF copies in a database that we can mirror in Ignite.
  ACTION ITEM: Share GCI Data Scout GPT w/ 3 testers; coordinate w/ Shallan on licenses - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/zK1swLYwmSAYcfKfmL_GLNTrsePp-FLZ?timestamp=312.9999  And we know that works, and we've tried it. So like 80% of what we'd be looking for, we can get there.  I just want to see if we can get it direct first versus going down that road. So those are kind of, I guess, yeah, I want to give you a list of the probably three people, and I'll have Shallan make sure we get all the licensing and stuff going.  But I don't know if you'll need to share this data scout with them, or if it's already shared with everybody that's in this AI task force thing that we've got.

5:47 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  I think it might just be shared with you, and I'm not sure if I need to open it up or if you can, but I'll look and I can, yeah, I can look at that.

5:57 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Um, yeah. I can, oh, I think I can share. Let's see what it says. I haven't tried anything. Oh, no, that's an individual thing.  That's trying to share the one that I just had up.

6:16 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Let's see. GCI Data Scout. Well, you, uh, do you have the ability to edit the GPT?

6:34 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  I do.

6:36 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Okay.

6:37 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Let's see what it does. Oh, here we go. I wonder, it has a, if I click the share, access invite only, let me see if I can do it with Shallan right now, because she's already in this.  I know she's in here.

6:55 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Yeah. Yeah, because you've got the, anyone at AI. Task Force with the link, or you can share it with the whole AI Task Force.

7:04 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  I wonder how I get her name in here. ShareGPT. Add people from your workspace. Let's just say... Can I do it?  Let's see again what it did. No, that didn't work. It's probably just me not having to... Let me... Let's see if I can do it with an email.  Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Okay. I figured it out.

7:38 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Awesome.

7:41 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Sweet. And it looks like I have edit access. I just gave her chat access. So if I... I'm not going to mess with this until I talk to you, if there's anything.
  ACTION ITEM: Investigate direct ACC access for GCI Data Scout; report feasibility/effort to Tom - WATCH: https://fathom.video/share/zK1swLYwmSAYcfKfmL_GLNTrsePp-FLZ?timestamp=482.9999  But it's neat to know that I can make adjustments to it. If I wanted to. Sweet. Sweet. Awesome. So I'll get the sharing going with the people we need because I need to get them in our little, whatever this little group is that we've got going here.  And if you have time to check out ACC and see if we can get access to that or in what it might take to get access to that, think that'd be a great next step just to have a better understanding of what kind of effort that might take.  Not to, like, make too big of a deal out of this, but just so you know, I have, I could get you a lot of people that would want to do this and pay you a lot of money just to set it up.

8:49 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Sure.

8:51 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  I don't want, let's make it work first, but there's a lot of, and just more of this, like, what we're, what us as contractors.

9:00 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Contractors are all battling with right now.

9:02 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  I got like three companies trying to sell me the same thing through their own little software thing that they've created.  We're testing some on the side, but they're trying to charge on a monthly user basis because of course they're administering it and they're doing something, but they're also just trying to make themselves rich and sell their companies to other big companies and all that kind of stuff.  Where I think what you've done here, obviously you just have done it on an hourly basis, but I think you could probably sell it pretty easily to other people or my friends on just much more of a, hey, I can set this up for you for five grand or 10 grand or whatever it might be.  That doesn't include any service or anything else, and who knows what happens with this stuff, but this is what you get, and you'd have a ton of people that would be really excited about it.  Awesome.

9:56 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Yeah, yeah.

10:00 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Just anyway, that's a, we'll, we'll, we'll get there, but I do think it could be kind of a neat opportunity for you.

10:07 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Appreciate it. Yeah.

10:09 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Yeah. Hit, hit repeat on something that you figure out and have people value it.

10:14 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  So, yeah. Yeah. It was a little bit more finicky than I expected, but you worked through it.

10:20 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  How much, how much time have you spent on it so far?

10:23 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  I think total on this one, probably like 15 hours.

10:26 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Okay.

10:27 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Yeah.

10:28 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  So, yeah, I, I'm, it's, this is, for me, it's like, like, like I said, we're, we're looking at other options.  We're talking to these companies and they're all trying to sell us stuff and every one of them takes our time to help make it work in our system too.

10:48 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  So it's not just, it's not just their time. It's our time on top of it. Right.

10:53 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Um, yeah, just trying to have a better feel for, you know, overall cost. Lots of our different options and the pros and cons.  And I think I'm really excited about where this is headed and kind of what I think we'll be able to make work.

11:09 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Awesome. Cool. Great.

11:13 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Awesome. I don't know. Do you have any other, anything else for me to help keep going?

11:21 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  No, I think I'll do another kind of, yeah, like you said, we talked about Ignite and ACC in the beginning, but I kind of focused on Ignite.  So I'll just jump back over to ACC and see if they have similar options, you know.

11:34 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Cool. I'm guessing they're going to be a little less, it's going to be less easy or they're going to be tighter with their data because they're trying to sell AI options, I'm sure, within the software.  And they'll have it soon, which is also why I'm not like incredibly, I'm not, I don't want to spend like $100,000 trying to make it work and hire somebody full-time to keep it working.  You know what I mean?

11:58 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Yeah, yeah.

11:59 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  But. But if there's a way for us to, if there's a way for us to do it in a relatively easy way, I'd be, I'd be happy to have it.  And I can show you what it's doing internally, but just having people be able to go to one place to do the initial research, there's some value there versus having to, you know, oh, jump into ACC, try and figure that out here, try and figure this out over here and put it all together.

12:24 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  So, yeah, for sure. All right. Yeah, so I'll do that and I'll get back to you when I find something out, whether it's clear if yes or no, know, whether for ACC.

12:37 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  My initial search in some of it sounded like companies had figured out how to do it. I just don't know how much effort it had come to figure it out.  You know, like, these are big billion-dollar companies with full-on, you know, big tech teams and stuff where, yeah, I think, well, anyway, that's how a bunch of constructions.  Software gets started and developed anyway, as people doing in-house stuff and then selling it to other people later.

13:07 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Right.

13:08 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Anyway, cool. I don't know. Just wanted to, like, now I'm really excited about it and excited about where it's headed, so.

13:17 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Thanks. No, it's great to hear. So glad that, yeah, something's coming out of it.

13:22 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Hit me up if you get anything or if you have any other questions. If not, good luck.

13:30 - Justin  Headley (sagemindai.io)
  Yeah, we'll chat soon.

13:31 - Tom Southam (GCI General Contractors)
  All right. Thank you. Thank you.
